iOS App to be used for Field events in a Track and Field Competition

##################
### Motivation ###
##################
Track and Field requires event proctors to record the results of each athlete in a given competition. Running events like the 100m dash or the 5000m run have automatic timers that take photo finishes of the athletes as they cross the finish line so their results are recorded digitally. In field events such as the long jump or the hammer throw, these results are still recorded using a piece of paper and clip board (at lease up at the collegiate level). Once the event concludes, the proctors must often enter their results into a database online. To avoid this overhead, an iPad can be utilized to record results digitally. The completed results can then be exported as a csv or equivalent file format to be entered into the database. The goal of this app is to get an idea down for recording app results digitally for field proctors to use during their competitions.

### Requirements ###
####################
This is an iOS app so the basic requirements to run the code is to be using a device that runs macOS. The app is built using Swift 3 so the target platform is for iOS 10 and up. The app is made specifically for the iPad as well. This is not meant for smaller screens such as the iPhone or iPod Touch.

### Future Developement ###
###########################
I have put the development of this app on hold for right now. My main developing platform has switched from a MacBook to an Arch Linux computer. Until I decide to put manually install macOS or buy a MacBook to develop on again, no further development will be done.
